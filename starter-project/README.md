# Entelect React Native

## Preface

This project serves as a seed for Entelect's React Native incubator. It is a minimalist project that should help you hit the ground running.

## Getting Started

In order to get you environments up and running for this project, follow the steps detailed in React Native's [getting started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). It is important to follow their **Building Projects with Native Code** guide and not at their **Quick Start** guide, as the **Quick Start** is only intended for Expo projects.
